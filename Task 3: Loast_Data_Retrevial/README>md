# Task 3: Lost Data Retrieval - Arch Technologies

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of forensic data recovery from a removable storage device. The goal was to simulate accidental data loss and use industry-standard tools to retrieve the lost information successfully.

## Technical Specifications
* **Device:** 16GB USB Flash Drive
* **File System:** FAT32
* **Tool Used:** Recuva (v1.54.120)
* **Target File:** Cyber Security (Month 2).pdf

## Methodology
1. **Scenario Simulation:** A PDF file was stored on a FAT32 formatted drive and then permanently deleted.
2. **Scanning:** Used Recuva to perform a targeted scan of the `E:\` drive.
3. **Identification:** The tool identified the file `Cyber Security (Month 2).pdf` with an "Excellent" state, meaning it had not been overwritten.
4. **Recovery:** The file was restored to a separate local directory (`C:\Downloads\Recover Folder`) to prevent data corruption.

## Results
* **Recovery Status:** 100% Successful
* **File Integrity:** The recovered PDF remains fully functional and readable.

## Evidence
Screenshots of the recovery process are located in the `/screenshots` folder.
